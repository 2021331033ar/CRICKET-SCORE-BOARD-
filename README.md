# CRICKET-SCORE-BOARD-
# Description

Cricket second most popular game in the world. Most peoples are just 
crazy about this sport there is multiple application to check cricket scores, 
it is quite a tough job to maintain a live score of cricket, but we can create 
a simple C++ to display Cricket score, we can create using 
basic knowledge.

# Overview

Develop a Cricket Tournament Management System in C++. This system 
will allow users to input and manage details of multiple matches within 
a tournament. The program should keep track of batsmen, bowlers, 
match summaries, and tournament statistics.<br>
**1.Tournament Setup:**<br>
• Allow the user to set up a new cricket tournament by 
providing details such as the number of teams participating 
and the schedule of matches.<br>
**2.Match Details:**<br>
• Extend the current code to support multiple matches within 
the tournament.<br>
• For each match, record details such as date, venue, and 
participating teams.<br>
**3. Player Performance Tracking:**<br>
• Enhance the system to keep track of the performance of 
individual players in each match.<br>
• Record runs, wickets, boundaries (fours and sixes), and other 
relevant statistics.<br>
**4.Team Statistics:**<br>
• Calculate and display team statistics, including total runs 
scored, total wickets taken, average run rate, etc.<br>
**5. Match Summaries:**<br>
• Provide an option to view detailed match summaries, 
including scores, top performers, and other relevant 
information.<br>

# Implementation Steps

**1. Extend the Data Structures:**<br>
• Modify and extend the existing structures to support multiple 
matches and teams.<br>
**2. Update Input and Output Functions:**<br>
• Modify input and output functions to handle the new data 
structure and additional details.<br>
**3. Enhance Player and Team Statistics Calculation:**<br>
• Implement functions to calculate and update player and team 
statistics based on match performances.<br>
**4. Implement Tournament Summary:**<br>
• Develop a function to generate a summary of the entire 
tournament, highlighting top performers and overall 
statistics.<br>

**5. Testing:**<br>
• Thoroughly test the system with various scenarios to ensure 
accuracy and reliability.<br>

# Project Goal
Create a Cricket Statistics Analyzer in C++ that allows users to input and 
analyze detailed statistics of batsmen and bowlers. The program should 
provide a user-friendly interface to view individual player details, match 
summaries, and generate insights based on the recorded data.
